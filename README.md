# Fake-Location
Java Android app that lets the user change their location anywhere they want in the world. 
With a simple interface, the user can search the desired location in the search bar and
long press to set the location there. The app sends a notification to the user regarding the
chosen place to remind them the address and the user can tap on the notification
to choose a new location.

What I learned during development:
- how to use the location manager to set a desired location
- how to use the google maps API
- how to customise the styling of the base map using a JSON object
- how to write clean, maintainable code for future access
- how to document the code

TODO: Attach link of how the app works.
