# Fake-Location
The Android Java app allows users to change their location to anywhere in the world by using a search bar to locate the desired place. Once the user has selected the location, the app zooms in on the chosen area, and the user can long-press to save the fake location. After saving, any app that the user uses will display the saved location as their current location. The app also sends notifications to remind the user of their selected location, and tapping on the notification allows the user to choose a new location. Additionally, the app uses the Google Maps API to display a world map with customized styling of the base map using a JSON object.

What I learned during development:

- How to integrate the Google Maps API into an Android app to display maps and allow for map interaction.
- How to use the search bar to retrieve location information from Google Maps API and display the location on the map.
- How to store and retrieve saved locations using local storage in the Android app.
- How to send notifications to users in Android apps and handle notification taps to allow for location changes.
- How to use JSON objects to customize the base map styling of Google Maps API in Android apps.
- How to write clean, maintainable code for future access
- How to document the code
